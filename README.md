# generative-art

An ongoing collection of generative artwork created by Sean Hughes using Processing.

## Description
Each folder in this repository is a different "project" or piece of artwork. 
The art is generated using Processing, a graphical library based on Java.

Each folder will contain one or more *.pde* files, which holds the code used to generate the art, as well as a *results* folder that holds some of the artwork it generated. To download the code and try it for yourself, you need to download 
*ColorPalettes.pde*, *NumberGenerator.pde*, and any *.pde* files in the specific artwork file itself. 

*ColorPalettes.pde* and *NumberGenerator.pde* are relied upon by every piece of art, as they just define nice colors to use, and a simple number generator, respectively. Note that the main *.pde* file inside the artwork itself was used to generate all the art in the *results* folder, however it is the most recent implementation of the code, so you may need to change some parameters slightly to generate the older artwork.

The pieces are in no particular order, so some of my older work is intermingled with the newer work. I would highly reccomend skimming through the *results* folder for any of the pieces that interest you, however **I have also included a *favorites* folder to display the specific pieces I am most proud of.**
